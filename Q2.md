## 📌 **Discussing the Impact of IT on Management in Light of Globalisation, Industrial Changes, Business Transformation, and the Digital Firm**

* **24/7 operations** across time zones

* **Global supply chain management** through ERP systems like SAP
  Managers must think globally but act locally, using data analytics and decision-support systems to tailor services while staying efficient at scale.

  Managers must adapt by learning to lead **remote teams**, manage **digital workflows**, and align IT with business goals.

### 4. 💻 **Emergence of the Digital Firm**

A digital firm uses IT in every aspect of its operations and strategy. Key characteristics include:

* **Business processes fully digitised** (e.g., Amazon automating order fulfilment)
* **Digital products and services** (e.g., Netflix, Airbnb)
* **IT as a core enabler** of business agility and customer experience

Management roles are redefined:

* Focus shifts to **digital transformation leadership**
* Greater emphasis on **cybersecurity**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **data-driven decision-making**

### 🎯 **Conclusion**

The digital era, driven by globalisation and industrial transformation, has revolutionised how management approaches operations, strategy, and customer engagement. Effective management today means leveraging IT not as a support function, but as a **central strategic tool** that empowers innovation, responsiveness, and competitive advantage.
